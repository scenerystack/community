 This repository houses discussions and resources for the developer community using the libraries within SceneryStack to create interactive simulations and other web interactives in HTML5.

## What is SceneryStack?

 SceneryStack is a collection of libraries built around a Model-View-Controller framework that can be used **together or separately** to support an interactive web project. PhET uses many or all of these libraries when creating an educational interactive simulation. Some libraries are more specific to our usage, including assets and branding, but most offer more generalizable use cases.

## Why use SceneryStack?

Wondering why SceneryStack might be your go-to choice for creating and rendering interactive content on the web? While there are numerous libraries available, SceneryStack stands out with its unique offerings. We pioneered the PhET Library to fill the gaps left by existing platforms. If you're looking for a comprehensive platform that scales, is flexible, and robust, SceneryStack is tailored for you!

## Common Code Libraries

See the [Stack List](./libraries/scenerystack_list.md) for all of the libraries that make up SceneryStack.

!!! note
    While the SceneryStack community is housed in the SceneryStack organization, all libraries for development using SceneryStack are in the **phetsims** GitHub organization found at <https://github.com/phetsims/>.

### phet-lib: Built version of the common code libraries üìö

 Looking for the core libraries in one build for your app? Download phet-lib from the [phet-lib repository](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib).

## Using SceneryStack to Make Web Interactives in HTML5

### Development Overview

For anyone interested in setting up a development environment, the [Development Overview](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-development-overview.md) is the best place to start. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the processes, tools, and best practices for developing with the libraries contained in SceneryStack. It also serves as the best starting point for creating interactive simulations, specifically.

### Additional Resources

In the [PhET documentation directory](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/tree/main/doc), you'll find a range of helpful resources for different aspects of development, including:

- **Dev Exercises**: Enhance your SceneryStack development skills with these hands-on exercises. Check out the [PhET dev exercises document](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-dev-exercises.md)
- **TypeScript Quickstart**: If you're new to TypeScript or need a refresher, you can follow our [TypeScript Quickstart guide](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/typescript-quick-start.md)
- **Coding Conventions**: Ensure your code is consistent and readable with our [coding conventions](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/coding-conventions.md)
- **Software Design Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with the [software design patterns](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md) used within PhET projects.
- **Accessibility Documentation**: Learn about designing accessibility features such as alternative input, screen-reader-friendly interactive description, and more through our development guidelines:
  - [Alternative Input Guide](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/alternative-input-quickstart-guide.md)
  - [Interactive Description Guide](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/interactive-description-technical-guide.md)

### In-Code Documentation

Often, the best documentation for each library is available in the code itself. As you navigate through the codebase, you'll find well-documented code with inline comments and annotations that explain how things work. We encourage you to explore the code as it can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Feel free to explore these documents and the code itself to get a deeper understanding of the PhET development ecosystem and to get started on your project. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the community support section or contact us directly.

## FAQ

### What is this repository for?

  Discussions, resources, and collaboration around the use and improvement of **SceneryStack** and its [constituent libraries](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-development-overview.md#source-code-and-dependencies), originally created and maintained by the software developers at the PhET Interactive Simulations project.

  This repository is not for discussions and help regarding PhET's educational, interactive simulations. For questions and comments regarding PhET's simulations, please keep reading or see the [PhET Interactive Simulations website](https://phet.colorado.edu/) for more information.

### What is the difference between SceneryStack and PhET Interactive Simulations?

 SceneryStack is the HTML5/JavaScript/TypeScript APIs (detailed above) that PhET Interactive Simulations are built on. The use of SceneryStack **is not limited to creating interactive science and math simulations!** It can be used to support the creation of all web interactives. SceneryStack supports rich and inclusive multimodal interaction, including the architecture to build robust alternative input and screen reader access when used in conjunction with our [Interactive Description Design Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/description-design-for-interactive-learning-resources).

 PhET Interactive Simulations are free educational science and math products created using SceneryStack by the designers and developers at the PhET Interactive Simulations Project. They are developed using [research-based, pedagogically-minded, and inclusive design methods](https://phet.colorado.edu/).

### I want to make an entirely new simulation using SceneryStack! What should I do?

#### If you are an individual or small group interested in or have made progress in making a new simulation

The best resources available to you can be found in the [PhET Development Overview](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-development-overview.md) and [other documentation](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/tree/main/doc) found in the `phet-info` repository. We have seen small test projects, academic projects (e.g., education research for a Ph.D.), or open source curriculum projects successfully develop custom simulations, leveraging our code base (See [Examples](#examples-using-scenerystack) above). It requires expertise in design and in JavaScript/TypeScript, but it is very possible for dedicated developers and teams. If you have made significant progress and are committed to your STEM simulation, please reach out to us through the [community discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/scenerystack/discussions) to discuss any support we may be able to provide.

#### If you are a commercial organization interested in making new simulations

See the [Source Code page of our website](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/about/source-code) for more information.

### What happens to my projects if these libraries stop being supported?

SceneryStack is the foundation of the PhET Interactive Simulations project. It is used in all of PhET's simulations and is actively maintained by the PhET team. PhET has no plans to stop supporting SceneryStack, so long as PhET Interactive Simulations continue to exist.
