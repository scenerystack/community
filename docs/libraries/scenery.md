# Getting Started

## Scenery

When using SceneryStack, Scenery will act as the foundation for your entire project.

Learn all the capabilities of Scenery in the [Scenery Documentation site](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/).

A good starting point is to take a [Tour of Scenery](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/a-tour-of-scenery.html).

## phet-lib

Ready to start working with the core libraries in your project? Download phet-lib from the [phet-lib repository](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib) ([*dist* directory](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib/tree/main/dist)).

## I don't know JavaScript development, how can I get started?

Well, first, welcome to the wonderful world of interactive web development! There are many ways to get started and many resources on the internet to support you.

You will want to pick up a basic understanding of HTML web development and a good understanding of JavaScript before getting started with SceneryStack.

The internet is full of resources to help you on your journey and a quick search will turn up many. Consider resources like [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which has also begun providing [courses in Spanish](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-course-in-spanish/).
