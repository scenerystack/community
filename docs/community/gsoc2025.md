### Implementing a Non-Modal Dialog Component for PhET Simulations
Project size: 90 hours
Estimated difficulty: Intermediate

Recommended Skills
* Proficiency in JavaScript and TypeScript
* Experience with web development (HTML, CSS)
* Familiarity with the PhET codebase and component architecture
* Knowledge of accessibility (a11y) standards and practices
* Optional: Experience with UI/UX design for educational software

### Description
PhET Interactive Simulations aim to make science and math learning engaging and accessible. While the current PhET simulations include modal dialogs for user interactions, there is a growing need for a non-modal dialog component. Non-modal dialogs allow users to interact with other parts of the application without closing the dialog, enhancing usability and accessibility.

Several PhET simulations have implemented custom solutions for non-modal dialogs, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges. This project involves developing a standardized, reusable non-modal dialog component within the PhET's Sun library (the UI component library). The component should address previous issues identified in custom implementations, such as proper focus management, positioning, and accessibility compliance.

### Expected Outcomes/Benefits/Deliverables
Non-Modal Dialog Component:

Develop a flexible and reusable non-modal dialog component within the PhET Sun library.
Support features such as customizable positioning, focus management, and interaction with underlying content.
Accessibility Compliance:

Ensure the component adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
Implement proper ARIA roles and keyboard navigation to make the dialog accessible to users with disabilities.
Integration and Refactoring:

Integrate the new non-modal dialog component into at least one existing PhET simulation, replacing custom implementations.
Refactor simulations like Mean Share and Balance, Natural Selection, and Models of the Hydrogen Atom to use the new component, if time permits.
Documentation and Guidelines:

Write comprehensive documentation on how to use the non-modal dialog component.
Provide guidelines for developers to incorporate the component into other simulations.
Testing and Quality Assurance:

Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
Work with the PhET team to perform user testing and gather feedback for improvements.

By implementing a standardized non-modal dialog component, this project will significantly improve the consistency and accessibility of PhET simulations. It will serve educators and learners who benefit from more interactive and flexible user interfaces, particularly those who rely on assistive technologies.
