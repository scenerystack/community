**Mentor:** Jonathan Olson

### Description  

SceneryStack supports the creation of accessible, flexible web interactives by providing keyboard access, screen reader compatibility, and other accessibility features. While these features are well integrated into **PhET Interactive Simulations**, there is a lack of practical examples demonstrating their use in interactive games.  

This project aims to develop a **fully accessible web-based game demo** using SceneryStack, showcasing **keyboard navigation, screen reader-compatible interactions, and customizable visual/audio features**. The game will serve as a **template and proof-of-concept** for making browser-based games more inclusive.  

### Key Tasks  

- **Game Concept and Design:** Select a game genre (e.g., board game, puzzle, card game, turn-based strategy). We recommend a simple game, but with sufficient complexity to demonstrate accessibility features, such as Chess.

- **Develop an Interactive Game with Accessibility Features:**  
  - Use [**SceneryStack**](https://scenerystack.org/) to create a working prototype with full accessibility support.  
    - Implement **keyboard navigation**, including arrow-key and shortcut controls.  
    - Support **interactive screen reader descriptions [(Interactive Description)](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/inclusive-design/features?section=interactive-description)** via a Parallel DOM, ensuring proper navigation and feedback.
    - Incorporate **Voicing features**, enabling auditory game feedback.  
    - Add **color customization options** to improve contrast for low-vision users.  
    - Implement **pan and zoom functionality** for adjustable views.  
  - **Collaborate with Designers:** Work with designers to create spoken descriptions that you will implement.

### Expected Outcomes/Benefits/Deliverables  

**Fully Functional Accessible Game** – A playable, if simple, web-based game with **comprehensive a11y support**, serving as a model for future projects.  

**Showcase of SceneryStack's Accessibility Features** – Demonstrating how developers can **integrate a11y-first principles** into game development.  

**Improved Web Gaming Accessibility** – Addressing the current lack of **keyboard-accessible** and **screen reader-friendly** online games.

### Why This Project?  

Many popular online games are **not keyboard or screen reader accessible**, making them unusable for many people with disabilities. For example, the most popular online Chess platforms do not offer keyboard navigation or screen reader support, or only offer the most mimimal support - not enough for a rich interactive experience.  

This project will serve as an **accessible alternative** and prove that web games **can** be both **engaging and inclusive** from the start. Unlike most games that require users to **find and activate** accessibility settings, SceneryStack aims to provide **clear accessibility features from the moment the page loads**—removing barriers to entry for all players.  

### How to Apply  

Interested contributors should participate in the [Project Discussion Thread](https://github.com/orgs/scenerystack/discussions/) (TODO: ADD SPECIFIC THREAD) to express their interest, ask questions, and engage with mentors and the PhET community.

**Mentor:** Jesse Greenberg

#### Description

Designing spoken descriptions for interactive web projects can be challenging, especially when iteration requires interacting with the screen reader to assess changes in real time. It is also difficult to communicate the intended experience to designers and developers who are not familiar with screen readers. The PhET Project has developed an "A11y (Accessibility) View" for interactive screen reader descriptions for PhET simulations. This view allows developers to see the spoken descriptions for interactive elements in real time, facilitating the design and implementation of accessible features. However, the current A11y View is specific to the PhET simulation context and does not work for other Scenery displays. This project in feature developments aims to generalize the A11y View to work for any Scenery display, enabling developers to create accessible web projects more efficiently.

This project will involve

#### Key Tasks

- Get Familiar with PDOM and Scenery: Learn about the Parallel DOM (PDOM) and Scenery frameworks used in PhET simulations.
- Understand the Current A11y View: Familiarize yourself with the existing a11y view in PhET simulations and how it interacts with the screen reader (e.g., [Greenhouse Effect A11y View](https://phet-dev.colorado.edu/html/greenhouse-effect/1.3.0-dev.6/phet/greenhouse-effect_a11y_view.html))
- Understand basics of description design framework: Understand the basics of the [description design framework]().
- Implement [a new instantiation of the A11y View](https://github.com/phetsims/chipper/issues/1512) from scratch in the [Scenery](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/) library.
- Develop a very simple interactive example to highlight the a11y view in action.

#### Expected Outcomes/Benefits/Deliverables

- Generalized A11y View: A new A11y View that works for any Scenery display, enabling developers to create accessible web projects more efficiently.
- Interactive Example: A simple interactive example demonstrating the A11y View in action.
- Improved Accessibility: Enhanced accessibility for web projects developed using Scenery, making them more inclusive and user-friendly.

### Description  

**SceneryStack** is an open-source web development framework designed for creating interactive, accessible web interfaces. While it includes core UI elements—such as buttons, sliders, and basic layout components—several **common UI patterns** are still missing. Many popular frameworks (e.g., Material UI, Bootstrap, Angular Material) provide a broad range of components such as dialogs (both modal and non-modal) and advanced form elements.  

This project invites contributors to **investigate popular UI frameworks** and **design/implement** new components for SceneryStack that align with **best practices** in accessibility, user experience, and coding standards. Example components that could be developed include:  

- **Non-Modal Dialog:** Allows the user to interact with the rest of the page while the dialog is open.  
- **Enhanced ComboBox / DropDown with a Refined Glass Pane Layer:** Improves the layering system so components like combo boxes can be used anywhere in the scene tree.  

By building these components to SceneryStack’s specifications—with a focus on **accessibility**—you will help grow the library’s functionality and empower developers to create more robust, inclusive interfaces.

Project scope depends on the complexity of the components chosen and the desired level of polish. Contributors are encouraged to discuss their ideas with the mentor and community to ensure alignment with SceneryStack’s goals.

### Key Tasks  

1. **Research and Planning**  
   - Investigate popular UI libraries (e.g., Material UI, Bootstrap, Angular Material) to understand typical UI patterns.  
   - Identify the **top missing components** in SceneryStack.

2. **Design and Prototyping**  
   - Create initial design specifications for **common, reusable UI components**—such as non-modal dialogs, advanced combo boxes, tab panels, or others.  
   - Collaborate with the mentor and community to ensure designs meet SceneryStack’s coding standards and accessibility guidelines.  

3. **Implementation with Accessibility in Mind**: Implement components with SceneryStack's accessibility features, such as keyboard navigation and screen reader support.  

4. **Integration and Refactoring**: Ensure new components integrate seamlessly into SceneryStack’s existing architecture.  
   - If needed, refactor relevant sections of the codebase (e.g., the glass pane layer) to improve maintainability and performance.
   - Create **developer-friendly documentation**, including code examples and usage guidelines.

5. **Testing and QA**  
   - Write **unit and integration tests** to verify component functionality and prevent regressions.
