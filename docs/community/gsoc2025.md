### Why This Project?  

Many popular online games are **not keyboard or screen reader accessible**, making them unusable for many people with disabilities. Here are some examples:  

- **[Chess.com](https://www.chess.com/play/computer)** – No keyboard accessibility.  
- **[Lichess](https://lichess.org/)** – Has a "blind mode," but usability is unclear.  
- **[RoyalUr](https://royalur.net/)** – Not keyboard accessible.  
- **[Washington Post Blackjack](https://games.washingtonpost.com/games/blackjack)** – Inaccessible; #1 search result for "keyboard-accessible blackjack."  

Our game will serve as an **accessible alternative** and prove that web games **can** be both **engaging and inclusive** from the start.  

Unlike most games that require users to **find and activate** accessibility settings, our project aims to provide **clear accessibility features from the moment the page loads**—removing barriers to entry for all players.

### Project 4: Develop Missing Components for SceneryStack UI Library

Project Size: 90 hours
Estimated difficulty: Intermediate
Recommended Skills: JavaScript and basic Typescript
[Project Discussion Thread](https://github.com/orgs/scenerystack/discussions) <!--TODO: ADD SPECIFIC THREAD
**Mentor(s):** (To be determined)

#### Description

Investigate popular UI frameworks and create common, but missing UI components in SceneryStack (to SceneryStack spec w/ a11y) e.g., Create a non-modal dialog sun#916. Improve the glass pane layer so ComboBox can operate without a “parent” being passed in.

PhET Interactive Simulations aim to make science and math learning engaging and accessible. While the current PhET simulations include modal dialogs for user interactions, there is a growing need for a non-modal dialog component. Non-modal dialogs allow users to interact with other parts of the application without closing the dialog, enhancing usability and accessibility.

Several PhET simulations have implemented custom solutions for non-modal dialogs, leading to inconsistencies and maintenance challenges. This project involves developing a standardized, reusable non-modal dialog component within the PhET's Sun library (the UI component library). The component should address previous issues identified in custom implementations, such as proper focus management, positioning, and accessibility compliance.

#### Key Tasks

Non-Modal Dialog Component:
Develop a flexible and reusable non-modal dialog component within the PhET Sun library.
Support features such as customizable positioning, focus management, and interaction with underlying content.

Accessibility Compliance:
Ensure the component adheres to accessibility standards (e.g., WCAG).
Implement proper ARIA roles and keyboard navigation to make the dialog accessible to users with disabilities.

Integration and Refactoring:
Integrate the new non-modal dialog component into at least one existing PhET simulation, replacing custom implementations.
Refactor simulations like Mean Share and Balance, Natural Selection, and Models of the Hydrogen Atom to use the new component, if time permits.

Documentation and Guidelines:
Write comprehensive documentation on how to use the non-modal dialog component.
Provide guidelines for developers to incorporate the component into other simulations.

Testing and Quality Assurance:
Conduct thorough testing across different browsers and devices to ensure compatibility.
Work with the PhET team to perform user testing and gather feedback for improvements.

By implementing a standardized non-modal dialog component, this project will significantly improve the consistency and accessibility of PhET simulations. It will serve educators and learners who benefit from more interactive and flexible user interfaces, particularly those who rely on assistive technologies.
