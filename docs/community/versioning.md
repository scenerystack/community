# Versioning and Breaking Changes

SceneryStack's main branch code is constantly evolving. The maintainers strive to maintain backward compatibility, but sometimes breaking changes are necessary to improve the framework.

See the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/scenerystack) for the latest version of SceneryStack.

As versions of the NPM package are released, the maintainers will also update SceneryStack documentation to reflect the latest changes. The documentation is intended to be up to date with the latest version of SceneryStack. After 1.0, it is anticipated that you will be able to find archived documentation by changing the version at the top of the SceneryStack website. <!-- TODO: update this when 1.1 or later is released -->

You can [bundle your own version](https://scenerystack.org/learn/modifying-scenerystack/#getting-the-latest-code) from the main branch, but be aware that it may contain breaking changes for your project. Reach out to the maintainers if you have questions about the latest changes on the [community platforms](https://scenerystack.org/community/join).
