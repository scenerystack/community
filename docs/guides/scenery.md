# Getting Started

When using SceneryStack, Scenery will act as the foundation for your entire project.

Learn all the capabilities of Scenery in the [Scenery Documentation site](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/).

A good starting point is to take a [Tour of Scenery](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/a-tour-of-scenery.html).

Ready to start working with the core libraries in your project/app? Download phet-lib from the [phet-lib repository](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib) ([*dist* directory](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib/tree/main/dist)).

See the [Stack List](../guides/scenerystack_list.md) for all of the libraries that make up SceneryStack.

## phet-lib

Long story short, https://github.com/phetsims/phet-vite-demo is a demo with simple steps to be able to get started (just requires git/npm/node, and is only checking out ONE repo). https://www.npmjs.com/package/phet-lib is an NPM package that can serve the entire whole of our common code. https://github.com/phetsims/phet-vite-demo/blob/main/src/main.ts is the code to run it.
I'll want to factor out some of the annoyances (like our preloads currently), but it's pretty close to the "toss phet-lib in package.json and import/use" by arbitrary rpojects.

!!! note
    While the *SceneryStack community* is housed in the SceneryStack GitHub organization, **all libraries for development** using SceneryStack are in the **phetsims** GitHub organization found at <https://github.com/phetsims/>.

### In-Code Documentation

Often, the best documentation for each library is available in the code itself. As you navigate through the codebase, you'll find well-documented code with inline comments and annotations that explain how things work. We encourage you to explore the code as it can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Feel free to explore these documents and the code itself to get a deeper understanding of the PhET development ecosystem and to get started on your project. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the community support section or contact us directly.
