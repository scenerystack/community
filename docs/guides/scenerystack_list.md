!!! warning
    Please note that while the documentation and npm package can be found at `scenerystack/community` and `scenerystack/scenerystack`, respectively, the latest library repositories currently exist in the `phetsims` organization (e.g., `phetsims/scenery` or `phetsims/kite`). 
    
    Keep this in mind when submitting contributions and remember to check your current SceneryStack version against the latest on the `main` branches.

!!! warning
    All new code in SceneryStack is being developed in TypeScript, but some older repositories still contain JavaScript.
