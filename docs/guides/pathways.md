# Development Pathways using SceneryStack

!!! info
    While the *SceneryStack community* is housed in the SceneryStack GitHub organization, **all libraries for development** using SceneryStack are in the **phetsims** GitHub organization found at <https://github.com/phetsims/>.

Ready to get started with SceneryStack? Choose your path:

## Path 1: Using SceneryStack for Web Projects




## Path 2: Using SceneryStack to make Interactive STEM Simulations

Looking to make your own interactive STEM simulation? Whether you plan to work with the PhET project or brand it yourself, head over to [SceneryStack for Simulations](./simulation/simulation-development.md) to get started.

## Path 3: I don't know JavaScript development, how can I get started?
<!-- warnings about TS, libraries developed without type enforcement because using TypeScript, can break things going pure JS,  -->

Well, first, welcome to the wonderful world of interactive web development! There are many ways to get started and many resources on the internet to support you.

You will want to pick up a basic understanding of HTML web development and a good understanding of JavaScript before getting started with SceneryStack.

!!! warning
    At this time, some SceneryStack libraries are written in JavaScript (JS) while newer libraries are in [TypeScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-typescript-beginners-guide/#:~:text=cheat%20sheet%20PDF-,What%20is%20TypeScript%3F,-TypeScript%20is%20a) (TS), with future updates to the libraries converting JS to TS. The [toolchain](../info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md#building-the-simulation-with-chipper) in use by PhET to create simulations assumes TS integration with respect to type assertions, and you may run into difficulties using JS. Please keep this in mind during your learning journey and do not be afraid to ask for help!

The internet is full of resources to help you on your journey and a quick search will turn up many. Consider resources like [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which has also begun providing [courses in Spanish](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-course-in-spanish/).

As soon as you can, start tinkering with SceneryStack and building projects to become familiar with the framework and begin your goal project!
