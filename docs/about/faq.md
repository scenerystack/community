# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is this community for?

  Discussions, resources, and collaboration around the use and improvement of **SceneryStack** and its [constituent libraries](../getting-started/scenerystack_list.md), maintained by the software developers at the PhET Interactive Simulations project.

  This repository is not for discussions and help regarding PhET's educational, interactive simulations. For questions and comments regarding PhET's simulations, please keep reading or see the [PhET Interactive Simulations website](https://phet.colorado.edu/) for more information.

## What is the difference between SceneryStack and PhET Interactive Simulations?

 SceneryStack is the HTML5/JavaScript/TypeScript APIs (detailed above) that PhET Interactive Simulations are built on. The use of SceneryStack **is not limited to creating interactive science and math simulations!** It can be used to support the creation of all web interactives. SceneryStack supports rich and inclusive multimodal interaction, including the architecture to build robust alternative input and screen reader access when used in conjunction with our [Interactive Description Design Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/description-design-for-interactive-learning-resources).

 PhET Interactive Simulations are free educational science and math products created using SceneryStack by the designers and developers at the PhET Interactive Simulations Project. They are developed using [research-based, pedagogically-minded, and inclusive design methods](https://phet.colorado.edu/).

### Where can I get help or provide feedback for using a PhET Interactive Simulation?

For anything involving PhET-created simulations, see the [PhET website](https://phet.colorado.edu).

- To request **new PhET Simulations or new features in PhET Simulations**, follow the links on the [Getting Started section of the Help Center](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/help-center/getting-started#:~:text=I%20have%20a%20sim%20idea.%20Where%20can%20I%20send%20it%3F).
- **For help or questions related to using PhET Simulations**, please see our [website](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/help-center/getting-started) or e-mail [phethelp@colorado.edu](mailto:phethelp@colorado.edu).
- **To report a problem for a specific PhET Simulation**. Open the PhET menu on the navigation bar of the simulation and select “Report a Problem…” to submit a bug report using the provided form.

## What should I do to participate in the SceneryStack Community?

## I want to make an entirely new simulation using SceneryStack! What should I do?

### If you are an individual or small group interested in or have made progress in making a new simulation

The best resources available to you can be found in the [Development Overview](../info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md) and other documentation found or linked to on this site. Small test projects, academic projects (e.g., education research for a Ph.D.), or open source curriculum projects have all successfully developed custom simulations, leveraging our code base (See [Simulation Examples](../simulation/simulation-examples.md)). It requires expertise in design and in JavaScript/TypeScript, but it is very possible for dedicated developers and teams. If you have made significant progress and are committed to your STEM simulation, please reach out to us through the [community discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/scenerystack/discussions) to discuss any support we may be able to provide.

### If you are a commercial organization interested in making new simulations

See the [Source Code page of our website](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/about/source-code) for more information.

## What happens to my projects if these libraries stop being supported?

SceneryStack is the foundation of the PhET Interactive Simulations project. It is used in all of PhET's simulations and is actively maintained by the PhET team. PhET has no plans to stop supporting SceneryStack, so long as PhET Interactive Simulations continue to exist.

## Do I have to brand my projects with PhET?

No! If you are creating a simulation, you can brand it however you like, but please contact us before using any PhET branding. See [Licensing](#licensing) below for more information.

See the [brand](https://github.com/phetsims/brand) library for help creating you own brand, as well as looking at the [Development Overview](../info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md).
