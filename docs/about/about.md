## What is SceneryStack?

 SceneryStack is a collection of libraries built around a Model-View-Controller framework that can be used **together or separately** to support an interactive web project. PhET uses many or all of these libraries when creating an educational interactive simulation. Some libraries are more specific to PhET's usage, including assets and scenery-phet, but most offer more generalizable use cases.
