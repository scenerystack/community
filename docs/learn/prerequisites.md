    This section and others in Getting Started with SceneryStack are under heavy revisement
    and will be updated by the end of 2024.

## Installing Prerequisites

Before working with SceneryStack, ensure you have the following tools installed:

1. **Command Line Interface**  
   Use Terminal (macOS/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows) to interact with the system.

2. **Git**  
   Git is required to check out the PhET code from GitHub. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).  
   On macOS, the preferred method is to install Xcode command-line tools. Follow the instructions at [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

3. **Node.js and npm**  
   Node.js and npm are required to install dependencies and run build processes. Download and install the latest version from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Development Environment

SceneryStack works well with most popular IDEs. Visual Studio Code (VSCode) is a great option for its excellent TypeScript support and ease of use. Many SceneryStack maintainers also use WebStorm, which offers advanced features like intelligent code navigation and debugging. Either choice will work, so feel free to use the IDE you’re most comfortable with!
