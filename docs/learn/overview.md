    This section and others in Getting Started with SceneryStack are under heavy revisement
    and will be updated by the end of 2024.

Welcome to SceneryStack! This page will give you a brief overview of the SceneryStack library and its features.

## What is SceneryStack?

## Ways to Use SceneryStack

SceneryStack is a TypeScript library. While it can be used with JavaScript, TypeScript is recommended since the API doesnâ€™t enforce runtime type checks, making JavaScript usage more challenging.

## Imports

SceneryStack is built from a collection of modules, so its imports are split into different parts.
For instance, to import a Scenery `Display`, you would use the following:

```js
import { Display } from 'scenerystack/scenery';
```

## Debugging

It is possible to enable SceneryStack's internal assertions with the following:

```js
import { enableAssert } from 'scenerystack/assert';

enableAssert();
```

Note that SceneryStack is built with TypeScript in mind, so most runtime type checks were removed in favor of compile-time checks.
