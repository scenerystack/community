## Create Highly Interactive Content for a Multimodal and Accessible Web

[SceneryStack](./learn/overview.md) is an open-source TypeScript framework designed to create powerful, interactive, and accessible web experiences. SceneryStack offers web development libraries for building engaging simulations, educational tools, or next-generation web applications. Included is support for robust accessibility features like dynamic screen-reader descriptions and alternative input (e.g., keyboard navigation).

??? abstract "**Learn about SceneryStack's features and capabilities**"
    For a full list of features and capabilities, check out all of the [**FEATURES**](./learn/features.md).

    | _Rendering and Data Handling_ | _Input and Accessibility Features_ |
    |-----------------------------|----------------------------------|
    | **Cross-Platform Capabilities**: Shield from bugs and quirks of modern browsers. | **Screen Reader Access**: Novel and effective access using the research-backed Parallel Document Object Model (PDOM) ([Experience "Interactive Description"](https://youtu.be/gj55KDRdhM8)). |
    | **Offline Support**: Downloadable, fully offline, single-file artifacts. | **Dynamic Spoken Content**: Customizable through Web Speech ([Experience "Voicing"](https://youtu.be/mwCc_NDmqx4)). |
    | **Pixel-Perfect Design**: Optimized for high pixel density devices with color profile support. | **Interactive Highlighting**: Extends visual accessibility features to pointer/touch input. |
    | **CSS Abstraction & Animation**: Utilize the `Twixt` library for advanced animations. | **In-App Zooming**: Features like pinch-to-zoom and panning. |
    | **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures type safety and autocomplete. | **Multimodal Libraries**: Integrate Web Audio with `Tambo`, computer vision with `Tangible`, and experimental Vibration API support with `Tappi`. |
    | **Real-Time Updates**: Trace dependencies and updates using the `Axon` library. | **Enhanced Touch and Mouse Areas**: Extended touch handling including Swipe-to-Snag functionality. |
    | **Rich Component Library**: Build accessible components with ease. | **Extendable Input System**: Upholds foundational accessibility. |
    | **Multiple Rendering Support**: Seamless functionality across SVG, Canvas, and increasing WebGL support. | **Keyboard Traversal Order**: API to specify keyboard traversal order. |
    | **Innovative Layout Engine**: Advanced layout, shape computations, and CAG for interface components. | |
    | **Enhanced iframe Support**: Easier user interaction within iframes. | |
    | **Charts and Graphs**: Support using the `Bamboo` library. | |
    | **Declarative APIs**: Optimize performance and quality adjustments. | |

    **SceneryStack is also ready to be implemented with your favorite JS libraries and frameworks, such as React, Three.js, and more.**
