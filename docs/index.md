## Create Highly Interactive Content for a Multimodal and Accessible Web

SceneryStack is an open-source TypeScript framework designed to create powerful, interactive, and accessible web experiences. SceneryStack offers web development libraries for building engaging simulations, educational tools, or next-generation web applications. Included is support for robust accessibility features like dynamic screen-reader descriptions and alternative input (e.g., keyboard navigation).

SceneryStack was born from the work of [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/), where it powers STEM-focused interactives used by millions around the world. PhET continues to maintain and contribute to SceneryStack for the purposes of creating multimodal and accessible STEM interactives.
{==
**SceneryStack is in the early stages of transitioning to an independent open-source community, driven by a collective passion for a more people-friendly web.**
