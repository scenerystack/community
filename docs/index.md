# SceneryStack

## Create Highly Interactive Content for a Multimodal and Accessible Web

SceneryStack is an open-source Typescript framework for developing multimodal, accessible HTML5 web interactives. SceneryStack offers libraries suitable for general web interactive development, as well as those specifically tailored toward creating interactive simulations. Included is support for robust accessibility features like dynamic screen-reader descriptions and alternative input (e.g., keyboard navigation).
<!-- TODO: expand on accessibility, inc PDOM and abstraction for descriptions -->

The development libraries within SceneryStack were originally created by [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/) to create educational interactive simulations. PhET continues to maintain and contribute to SceneryStack for the purposes of creating multimodal and accessible STEM interactives.

**SceneryStack is in the early stages of transitioning to an independent open-source community, driven by a collective passion for a more people-friendly web.**

## Flexibility and Accessibility

### Rendering and Graphics

- **Cross-Platform Capabilities**: Shield from bugs and quirks of modern browsers.
- **Offline Support**: Downloadable, fully offline, single-file artifacts.
- **Pixel-Perfect Design**: Optimized for high pixel density devices with color profile support.
- **CSS Abstraction & Animation**: Utilize the `Twixt` library for advanced animations.
- **TypeScript Integration**: Ensures type safety and autocomplete.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Trace dependencies and updates using the `Axon` library.
- **Rich Component Library**: Build accessible components with ease.
- **Multiple Rendering Support**: Seamless functionality across SVG, Canvas, and increasing WebGL support.
- **Innovative Layout Engine**: Advanced layout, shape computations, and CAG for interface components.
- **Enhanced iframe Support**: Easier user interaction within iframes.
- **Charts and Graphs**: Support using the `Bamboo` library.
- **Declarative APIs**: Optimize performance and quality adjustments.

### Input

- **Enhanced Touch and Mouse Areas**: Extended touch handling including Swipe-to-Snag functionality.
- **Extendable Input System**: Upholds foundational accessibility.
- **Keyboard Traversal Order**: API to specify keyboard traversal order.

### Accessibility and Inclusive Features

- **Screen Reader Access**: Novel and effective access using the research-backed Parallel Document Object Model (PDOM) ([Experience "Interactive Description"](https://youtu.be/gj55KDRdhM8)).
- **Dynamic Spoken Content**: Customizable through Web Speech ([Experience "Voicing"](https://youtu.be/mwCc_NDmqx4)).
- **Interactive Highlighting**: Extends visual accessibility features to pointer/touch input.
- **In-App Zooming**: Features like pinch-to-zoom and panning.
- **Multimodal Libraries**: Integrate Web Audio with `Tambo`, computer vision with `Tangible`, and experimental Vibration API support with `Tappi`.

SceneryStack is also ready to be implemented with your favorite JS libraries and frameworks, such as React, Three.js, and more.
