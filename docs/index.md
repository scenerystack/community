## What is SceneryStack?

 SceneryStack is a community built around a [collection of HTML5/TypeScript development libraries](./guides/scenerystack_list.md) in the Model-View-Controller framework that can be used **together or separately** to create a multimodal and accessible, web interactive. This includes support for robust accessibility features like dynamic and navigatable screen-reader descriptions. SceneryStack offers libraries specifically tailored to interactive, educational simulation development, in addition to being suitable for general web interactive development.
 
The development libraries were created by [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/) to create educational interactive simulations.

SceneryStack is in its early stages of becoming an independent community, distinct from PhET Interactive Simulations, and we're excited to see where it goes!

## A few answers to some common questions...

??? question "What is this site and community for?"
    Discussions, resources, and collaboration around the use and improvement of **SceneryStack** and its [constituent libraries](./guides/scenerystack_list.md), maintained by the software developers at the PhET Interactive Simulations project.

    This repository is not for discussions and help regarding PhET's educational, interactive simulations. For questions and comments regarding PhET's simulations, please keep reading or see the [PhET Interactive Simulations website](https://phet.colorado.edu/) for more information.

<!-- ??? info "What is the relationship between SceneryStack and PhET Interactive Simulations?"
    SceneryStack is the HTML5/JavaScript/TypeScript APIs (detailed above) that PhET Interactive Simulations are built on. The use of SceneryStack **is not limited to creating interactive science and math simulations!** It can be used to support the creation of all web interactives. SceneryStack supports rich and inclusive multimodal interaction, including the architecture to build robust alternative input and screen reader access when used in conjunction with our [Interactive Description Design Framework](https://www.coursera.org/learn/description-design-for-interactive-learning-resources).

    PhET Interactive Simulations are free educational science and math products created using SceneryStack by the designers and developers at the PhET Interactive Simulations Project. They are developed using [research-based, pedagogically-minded, and inclusive design methods](https://phet.colorado.edu/). -->

??? question "I want to make an interactive simulation using SceneryStack! What should I do?"
    **If you are an individual or small group interested in or have made progress in making a new simulation:**
    The best resources available to you can be found in the [Development Overview](./info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md) and other documentation found or linked to on this site. Small test projects, academic projects (e.g., education research for a Ph.D.), or open source curriculum projects have all successfully developed custom simulations, leveraging our code base (See [Simulation Examples](./guides/simulation-examples.md)). It requires expertise in design and JavaScript/TypeScript, but it is very possible for dedicated developers and teams. If you have made significant progress and are committed to your STEM simulation, please reach out to us through the [community discussion forum](https://github.com/orgs/scenerystack/discussions) to discuss any support we may be able to provide.

    **If you are a commercial organization interested in making new simulations:**
    See the [PhET website page regarding simulation development](https://phet.colorado.edu/en/about/source-code) for more information.

??? question "What happens to my projects if these libraries stop being supported?"
    SceneryStack is the foundation of the PhET Interactive Simulations project. It is used in all of PhET's simulations and is actively maintained by the PhET team. PhET has no plans to stop supporting SceneryStack, so long as PhET Interactive Simulations continue to exist.

??? question "Do I have to brand my projects with PhET?"
    No! If you are creating a simulation, you can brand it however you like, but please contact us before using any PhET branding. See [Licensing](#licensing) below for more information.

    See the [brand](https://github.com/phetsims/brand) library for help creating your brand, as well as looking at the [Development Overview](./info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md).

??? question "Where can I get help or provide feedback for using a PhET Interactive Simulation?"
    For anything involving specific PhET Interactive Simulations, see the [PhET website](https://phet.colorado.edu).
