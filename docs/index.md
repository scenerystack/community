SceneryStack was born from the work of [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/), where it powers STEM-focused interactives used by millions around the world. PhET continues to maintain and contribute to SceneryStack for the purposes of creating multimodal and accessible STEM interactives.
{==
**SceneryStack is in the early stages of transitioning to an independent open-source community, driven by a collective passion for a more people-friendly web.**
