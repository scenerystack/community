# <img src="assets/scenerystack-square.png" width="50"> SceneryStack - Web Interactives for the Multimodal Web

SceneryStack is an HTML5 development framework for creating multimodal, accessible web interactives. SceneryStack offers libraries suitable for general web interactive development, as well as those specifically tailored to STEM interactive simulations. Included is support for robust accessibility features like dynamic screen-reader descriptions and alternative input (e.g., keyboard navigation).

The development libraries were originally created by [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/) to create educational interactive simulations.

**SceneryStack is in its early stages of becoming an independent community, distinct from PhET Interactive Simulations, and we're excited to see where it goes!**
