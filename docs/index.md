# SceneryStack

## Create Highly Interactive Content for a Multimodal and Accessible Web

SceneryStack is an Typescript development framework for creating multimodal, accessible HTML5 web interactives. SceneryStack offers libraries suitable for general web interactive development, as well as those specifically tailored to STEM interactive simulations. Included is support for robust accessibility features like dynamic screen-reader descriptions and alternative input (e.g., keyboard navigation).

The development libraries within SceneryStack were originally created by [PhET Interactive Simulations](https://phet.colorado.edu/) to create educational interactive simulations. PhET continues to maintain and contribute to SceneryStack for the purposes of creating multimodal and accessible STEM interactives.

{==**SceneryStack is in the early stages of transitioning to an independent open-source community, driven by a collective passion for a more people-friendly web.**==}
