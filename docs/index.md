 This repository houses discussions and resources for the developer community using the libraries within SceneryStack to create interactive simulations and other web interactives in HTML5.

## What is SceneryStack?

 SceneryStack is a [collection of libraries](./getting-started/scenerystack_list.md) built around a Model-View-Controller framework that can be used **together or separately** to support an interactive web project. PhET uses many or all of these libraries when creating an educational interactive simulation. Some libraries are more specific to PhET's usage, including assets and scenery-phet, but most offer more generalizable use cases.

<!-- COMMUNITY OF SCIENCE INTERACTIVES -->

## Getting Started
### Path 1: Using Scenery/phet-lib for web projects

When using SceneryStack, Scenery will act as the foundation for your entire project.

Learn all the capabilities of Scenery in the [Scenery Documentation site](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/).

A good starting point is to take a [Tour of Scenery](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/a-tour-of-scenery.html).

Ready to start working with the core libraries in your project/app? Download phet-lib from the [phet-lib repository](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib) ([*dist* directory](https://github.com/phetsims/phet-lib/tree/main/dist)).

See the [Stack List](./getting-started/scenerystack_list.md) for all of the libraries that make up SceneryStack.

!!! note
    While the *SceneryStack community* is housed in the SceneryStack GitHub organization, **all libraries for development** using SceneryStack are in the **phetsims** GitHub organization found at <https://github.com/phetsims/>.

### Path 2: Using SceneryStack to Make Web Interactives in HTML5

For anyone interested in setting up a development environment, the [Development Overview](./info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md) is the best place to start. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the processes, tools, and best practices for developing with the libraries contained in SceneryStack. It also serves as the best starting point for creating interactive simulations, specifically.

If you're using SceneryStack, you'll likely be using Scenery, the primary view library that many other libraries rely on. [See Scenery's documentation here](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/)!

A [community-created guide from HNM Simulations](https://nm.mathforcollege.com/nmsims/HNM%20Simulations%20Documentation/_book/) provides a lot of helpful tips, though some information may be out of date.

### Path 3: I don't know JavaScript development, how can I get started?
<!-- warnings about TS, libraries developed without type enforcement because using TypeScript, can break things going pure JS,  -->

Well, first, welcome to the wonderful world of interactive web development! There are many ways to get started and many resources on the internet to support you.

You will want to pick up a basic understanding of HTML web development and a good understanding of JavaScript before getting started with SceneryStack.

The internet is full of resources to help you on your journey and a quick search will turn up many. Consider resources like [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which has also begun providing [courses in Spanish](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-course-in-spanish/).
