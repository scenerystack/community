# launchCounter

## Overview

Utility for counting the launches of a simulation, which is helpful when counting crashes during
extended fuzzing. Replaces the sim name with a title that indicates the run number.

NOTE: There is no easy way to clear the local storage for this value, so correct usage would focus on the differences
in values rather than the absolute values.
