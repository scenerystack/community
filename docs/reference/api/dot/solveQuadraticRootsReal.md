    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/dot/blob/main/js/util/solveQuadraticRootsReal.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/dot/blob/main/js/util/solveQuadraticRootsReal.ts) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Returns an array of the real roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c=0$, or null if every value is a
solution. If a is nonzero, there should be between 0 and 2 (inclusive) values returned.

@returns The real roots of the equation, or null if all values are roots. If the root has
         a multiplicity larger than 1, it will be repeated that many times.
