    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/dot/blob/main/js/util/lineLineIntersection.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/dot/blob/main/js/util/lineLineIntersection.ts) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Intersection point between the lines defined by the line segments p1-p2 and p3-p4. If the
lines are not properly defined, null is returned. If there are no intersections or infinitely many,
e.g. parallel lines, null is returned.
