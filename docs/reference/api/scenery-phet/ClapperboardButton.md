!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet/blob/main/js/ClapperboardButton.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet/blob/main/js/ClapperboardButton.ts) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

A Node that produces a variety of loud outputs to support data synchronizing during a recording.
This includes sound, visuals, and the PhET-iO data stream.

This is prototype code and intended to be used in studies with users to assist with data collection.
Not a typical UI component.

Next time this is used: Would be nice to emit a PhET-iO state when triggered
