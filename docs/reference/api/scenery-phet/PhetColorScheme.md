# PhetColorScheme

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet/blob/main/js/PhetColorScheme.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery-phet/blob/main/js/PhetColorScheme.ts) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Colors that are specific to PhET simulations.
Reuse these in sims whenever possible to facilitate uniformity across sims.
These should all be instances of phet.scenery.Color, since {Color} can typically be used anywhere but {string} cannot.

This is based on the google doc here:
