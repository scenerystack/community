    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/accessibility/pdomFocusProperty.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/accessibility/pdomFocusProperty.ts) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Display has an axon `Property to indicate which component is focused (or null if no
scenery Node has focus). By passing the tandem and phetioTye, PhET-iO is able to interoperate (save, restore,
control, observe what is currently focused). See FocusManager.pdomFocus for setting the focus. Don't set the value
of this Property directly.
