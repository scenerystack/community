# guessVisualTrail

## Overview

Since a "Trail" on PDOMInstance can have discontinuous jumps (due to pdomOrder), this finds the best
actual visual Trail to use, from the trail of a PDOMInstance to the root of a Display.

@param trail - trail of the PDOMInstance, which can containe "gaps"
@param rootNode - root of a Display
