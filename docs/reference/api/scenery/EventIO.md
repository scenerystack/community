    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at

## Overview

IOType for a self.Event. Since this needs to support any data from any subtype of self.Event, we supply NullableIO
attributes for the union of different supported subtypes.  The subtypes are listed at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event
