# voicingUtteranceQueue

## Overview

A singleton UtteranceQueue that is used for Voicing. It uses the voicingManager to announce Utterances,
which uses HTML5 SpeechSynthesis. This UtteranceQueue can take special VoicingUtterances, which
have some extra functionality for controlling flow of alerts.
