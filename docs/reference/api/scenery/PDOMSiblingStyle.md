# PDOMSiblingStyle

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/accessibility/pdom/PDOMSiblingStyle.js](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/accessibility/pdom/PDOMSiblingStyle.js) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Static CSS style for elements of the PDOM (siblings of PDOMPeer). Adds the styling directly to SceneryStyle,
but also exports the class names for root and siblings for where elements are created or retrieved
by document.getElementsByClassName().

REVIEW: Rename this to AccessiblePDOMStyle (or something more universal)
  - For all usages of "sibling" in this file.
