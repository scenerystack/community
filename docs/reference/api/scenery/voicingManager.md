# voicingManager

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/accessibility/voicing/voicingManager.ts](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/accessibility/voicing/voicingManager.ts) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

Uses the Web Speech API to produce speech from the browser. This is a prototype, DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION CODE.
There is no speech output until the voicingManager has been initialized. Supported voices will depend on platform.
For each voice, you can customize the rate and pitch. Only one voicingManager should be active at a time and so this
type is a singleton.
