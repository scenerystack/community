# HeightSizable

## Overview

HeightSizable is a trait that provides a minimum and preferred height. The minimum height is set by the component,
so that layout containers could know how "small" the component can be made. The preferred height is set by the
layout container, and the component should adjust its size so that it takes up that height.
