# WidthSizable

## Overview

WidthSizable is a trait that provides a minimum and preferred width. The minimum width is set by the component,
so that layout containers could know how "small" the component can be made. The preferred width is set by the
layout container, and the component should adjust its size so that it takes up that width.
