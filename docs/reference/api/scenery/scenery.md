!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This documentation is auto-generated, and is a work in progress. Please see the source code at
    [https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/scenery.js](https://github.com/phetsims/scenery/blob/main/js/scenery.js) for the most up-to-date information.

## Overview

The main 'scenery' namespace object for the exported (built) API. Used internally in some places where there are
potential circular dependencies.

The returned scenery object namespace may be incomplete if not all modules are listed as
dependencies. Please use the 'main' module for that purpose if all of Scenery is desired.
