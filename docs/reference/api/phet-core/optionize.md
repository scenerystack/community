# optionize

## Overview

Optionize is a TypeScript layer built on PHET_CORE/merge. Its goal is to satisfy type safety within PhET's "options"
pattern.

For up-to-date examples on how to use this file, see WILDER/WilderOptionsPatterns.ts

This pattern is still being solidified. Although the long term location of PhET's options pattern documentation
can be found at https://github.com/phetsims/phet-info/blob/main/doc/phet-software-design-patterns.md#options-and-config,
that document is currently out of date. Please see https://github.com/phetsims/phet-core/issues/128 for current
progress on this pattern.
