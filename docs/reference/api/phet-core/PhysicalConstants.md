# PhysicalConstants

## Overview

From wikipedia:
 &gt; A physical constant, sometimes fundamental physical constant or universal constant, is a physical quantity that is
 &gt; generally believed to be both universal in nature and have constant value in time. It is contrasted with a
 &gt; mathematical constant, which has a fixed numerical value, but does not directly involve any physical
 &gt; measurement.

Here is a link to examples of these types of "universal constants"
