# Scenery Implementation Notes

!!! warning "Under Construction"
    This document and others in this section are under heavy revision.

This document is intended to provide implementation notes for [Scenery](../learn/scenery-basics.md). It is not a user guide, but rather a reference for developers working on the Scenery codebase. It is not up to date at this time.

You can find the notes at the deprecated Scenery website: <https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/implementation-notes.html>
