For Scenery Layout: https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/layout, good to point people here instead of a Tour of Scenery. Tour of scenery is a bit more general, good for Scenery concepts.

- You should be able to just include phet-lib, then take the code from Tour of Scenery and it should just work!
- Could create more phet-lib examples using Tour of Scenery
- If you use dot or kite, the built version is a subset of phet-lib. Any examples in dot or kite can be used to create examples for phet-lib.
