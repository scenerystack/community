## Path 1: Using Scenery/phet-lib for web projects

When using SceneryStack, Scenery will act as the foundation for your entire project.

Learn all the capabilities of Scenery in the [Scenery Documentation site](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/).

A good starting point is to take a [Tour of Scenery](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/a-tour-of-scenery.html).

## Path 2: Using SceneryStack to Make Web Interactives in HTML5

### Development Overview

For anyone interested in setting up a development environment, the [Development Overview](../info-sync/simulation-development-overview.md) is the best place to start. It provides a comprehensive introduction to the processes, tools, and best practices for developing with the libraries contained in SceneryStack. It also serves as the best starting point for creating interactive simulations, specifically.

If you're using SceneryStack, you'll likely be using Scenery, the primary view library that many other libraries rely on. [See Scenery's documentation here](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/)!

A [community-created guide from HNM Simulations](https://nm.mathforcollege.com/nmsims/HNM%20Simulations%20Documentation/_book/) provides a lot of helpful tips, though some information may be out of date.

## Path 3: I don't know JavaScript development, how can I get started?
<!-- warnings about TS, libraries developed without type enforcement because using TypeScript, can break things going pure JS,  -->

Well, first, welcome to the wonderful world of interactive web development! There are many ways to get started and many resources on the internet to support you.

You will want to pick up a basic understanding of HTML web development and a good understanding of JavaScript before getting started with SceneryStack.

The internet is full of resources to help you on your journey and a quick search will turn up many. Consider resources like [freecodecamp.com](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), which has also begun providing [courses in Spanish](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-course-in-spanish/).
