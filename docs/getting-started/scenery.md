## Scenery

When using SceneryStack, Scenery will act as the foundation for your entire project.

Learn all the capabilities of Scenery in the [Scenery Documentation site](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/).

A good starting point is to take a [Tour of Scenery](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/a-tour-of-scenery.html).

### In-Code Documentation

Often, the best documentation for each library is available in the code itself. As you navigate through the codebase, you'll find well-documented code with inline comments and annotations that explain how things work. We encourage you to explore the code as it can provide the most accurate and up-to-date information.

Feel free to explore these documents and the code itself to get a deeper understanding of the PhET development ecosystem and to get started on your project. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please refer to the community support section or contact us directly.
