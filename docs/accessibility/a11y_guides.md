# Accessibility and Inclusive Design Resources

Accessibility (sometimes abbreviated *a11y*) is an important part of any design process. It is essential to the usability of your project for all users. This includes providing alternative text for images, ensuring that color contrast is sufficient, and making sure that the project is navigable using a keyboard. Inclusive design goes beyond accessibility to consider the needs of all users, including those with disabilities, different cultural backgrounds, and varying levels of experience with technology.

Accessibility and Inclusive Design have become a priority for many developers and designers. SceneryStack is [evolving toward being accessible by default](../learn/features.md), but there are many ways to enhance the accessibility of your project. This page provides resources and guides for creating accessible features in your SceneryStack project.

## Development Resources

Find important information about integrating accessibility into your SceneryStack project by getting up to speed with [Scenery Accessibility](../learn/scenery-accessibility.md).

[Accessibility in Scenery](../learn/scenery-accessibility.md){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

Component-level accessibility information can be found within [`sun` UI components](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/tree/main/doc)). Much, but not all, of this is organized within the in-progress [PhET Style Guide, Binder :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://phetsims.github.io/binder/).

### Interactive Description Design

Our first recommendation is to dive into a free crash course in Interactive Description - dynamic, navigatable screen-reader description design for web interactives:

[:fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square: Description Design for Interactives on Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/description-design-for-interactive-learning-resources){ .md-button }

The course includes a [:fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square: Course Resources Index](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Blnzy04KQmV_r6N3tXtt5f1tuw-MZ6J01TjP582QrAU/edit?tab=t.0#heading=h.rj5etgrq1nf7) that has a wealth of information about designing spoken descriptions for web interactives.
