# Accessibility and Inclusive Design Resources

Accessibility (sometimes abbreviated *a11y*) is an important part of any design process. It is essential to ensure that all users can access and use your project. This includes providing alternative text for images, ensuring that color contrast is sufficient, and making sure that the project is navigable using a keyboard. Inclusive design goes beyond accessibility to consider the needs of all users, including those with disabilities, different cultural backgrounds, and varying levels of experience with technology.

Accessibility and Inclusive Design have become a priority for many developers and designers. SceneryStack is [designed to be accessible by default](../learn/features.md), but there are many ways to enhance the accessibility of your project. This page provides resources and guides for creating accessible features in your SceneryStack project.

    You can also find tips for accessibly integrating features in some libraries (e.g., [`sun` UI components](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/tree/main/doc)). Much of this is organized within the in-progress [PhET Style Guide, Binder :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://phetsims.github.io/binder/).

Find important information about integrating accessibility into your SceneryStack project by getting up to speed with [Scenery Accessibility](../learn/scenery-accessibility.md).
