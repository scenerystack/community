    You can also find tips for accessibly integrating features in some libraries (e.g., [`sun` UI components](https://github.com/phetsims/sun/tree/main/doc)). Much of this is organized within the in-progress [PhET Style Guide, Binder :fontawesome-solid-arrow-up-right-from-square:](https://phetsims.github.io/binder/).

Find important information about integrating accessibility and inclusivity into your SceneryStack project by getting up to speed with [Accessibility in Scenery](https://phetsims.github.io/scenery/doc/accessibility/accessibility.html).
